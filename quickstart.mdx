# NoirX Discord Bot: License Redemption and Chat Channel Creation

The NoirX Discord bot enables you to redeem license keys to unlock premium features and automatically create dedicated chat channels. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setup, license redemption, and channel management, with complete code examples.

<Info>
NoirX is built with discord.js (v14) and requires Node.js v16.9.0 or higher. Ensure you have a Discord bot token and a server for testing.
